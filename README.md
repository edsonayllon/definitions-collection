## Designation xx-2020
# Definitions Collection
Collection of concepts and definitions of interest within mathematics and computer science as I discover them.

term | definition
--|--
overloaded | When a label, such as a word or symbol, is used as a reference to multiple meanings or executions.
fuzzing | The automated testing of inputs to discover vulnerabilities in mass.
attestation | Proof/evidence of something.
conjecture | Temporary conclusion on the basis of too little information. These are proposals, pending proof or disproof. 
formative | Giving shape. Relating to development and growth.
[formal reference](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/3336451.0009.205?view=text;rgn=main) | A work from which a new work was derived from. Work is broadly used here, and can take the meaning of an equation, document, standard, algorithm, etc. The simplest example is a direct qoutation.
[normative reference](https://www.iec.ch/standardsdev/resources/draftingpublications/directives/subdivision/normative_references.htm) | A required (mandatory) dependency of a new work. This dependency is externally held, existing on its own. Work, here, is broad as well, but often refers to documentation, such as specifications, procedures, and standards.
isomorphism | Having equal form. Two objects are defined equal if what defines them as objects is reduced to a selection of properties, and those descriptive properties are the same across the two objects (ie. two lists of the same length). When an array (or sequence) is mapped to a new array (each element is transformed by the same function), and the new array can undergo the reverse function of its mapping to become the old array, the two arrays are isomorphic. Example: `log exp x = x`, and `exp log x = x`. Or, `bs = as.map(a => a*2)` & `as = bs.map(b => b/2)`.
