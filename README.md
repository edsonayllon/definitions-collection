## Research 8-2020
# Definitions Collection
Collection of concepts and definitions of interest within mathematics and computer science as I discover them.

term | definition
---:|--
overloaded | When a label, such as a word or symbol, is used as a reference to multiple meanings or executions. Similar to how a synonym is when multiple labels reference the same meaning.
fuzzing | The automated testing of inputs to discover vulnerabilities in mass.
attestation | Proof/evidence provided by a witness.
conjecture | Temporary conclusion on the basis of too little information. These are proposals, pending proof or disproof. 
formative | Giving shape. Relating to development and growth.
[formal reference](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/3336451.0009.205?view=text;rgn=main) | A work from which a new work was derived from. Work is broadly used here, and can take the meaning of an equation, document, standard, algorithm, etc. The simplest example is a direct qoutation.
[normative reference](https://www.iec.ch/standardsdev/resources/draftingpublications/directives/subdivision/normative_references.htm) | A required (mandatory) dependency of a new work. This dependency is externally held, existing on its own.
scope | The extent, or extent covered.
coverage | The extent covered. Code coverage is the extent to which tests execute code written in a program.
parameter space | The scope of all possible parameters within a model (such as a function). When the parameters are of a function, it's just called the domain (short for "domain of definition").
designation | Giving an identity. A given title or role.
mapping | AKA map. When an object or structure (such as an array or sequence) is transformed to create a new object/structure via a function. Ie: `[1, 2, 3].map(n => n*2) == [2, 4, 6]`
inverse mapping | A mapping where the function used to map is an inverse function.
inverse function | A function whose inputs and outputs are the outputs and input, respectively, of another function. When a function of the inverse function, or the inverse function of a function is taken, the embedded functions become an identity function, `f(g(x)) = g(f(x)) = x`.
identity function | A function that returns its input. Examples: `f(x) = x`, `b = a.map(n -> {print(n); return n;}`
isomorphism | Having equal form. Two objects are considered equal if we reduce their definition to properties which are equal (ie. two lists of the same length). If we map an array to a new array, and can inversly map the new array back to the old array, these two arrays are isomporhic. Example: `bs = as.map(a => a*2)` & `as = bs.map(b => b/2)`, or `log exp x = x`, and `exp log x = x`. 
granularity | Relates to the number of pieces making a whole. As the number of components increases, so does the granularity.
unidirectional | One way.
bidirectional | Two way, usually in opposite directions.
learning | The result of a process reached when behavior has changed.
permanence | Quality of lasting forever, or a very long time
