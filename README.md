## Designation Unspecified 
# Definitions Collection
Collection of concepts and definitions of interest within mathematics and computer science as I discover them.

term | definition
--|--
overloaded | When a label, such as a word or symbol, is used as a reference to multiple meanings or executions.
fuzzing | The automated testing of inputs to discover vulnerabilities in mass.
attestation | Proof/evidence of something.
conjecture | Temporary conclusion on the basis of too little information. These are proposals, pending proof or disproof. 
formative | Giving shape. Relating to development and growth.
[formal reference](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/3336451.0009.205?view=text;rgn=main) | A work from which a new work was derived from. Work is broadly used here, and can take the meaning of an equation, document, standard, algorithm, etc. The simplest example is a direct qoutation.
[normative reference](https://www.iec.ch/standardsdev/resources/draftingpublications/directives/subdivision/normative_references.htm) | A required (mandatory) dependency of a new work. This dependency is externally held, existing on its own. Work, here, is broad as well, but often refers to documentation, such as specifications, procedures, and standards.
isomorphism | Having equal form. Two objects are considered equal if we reduce their definition to properties which are equal (ie. two lists of the same length). If we map an array to a new array, and can inversly map the new array back to the old array, these two arrays are isomporhic. Example: `bs = as.map(a => a*2)` & `as = bs.map(b => b/2)`, or `log exp x = x`, and `exp log x = x`. 
scope | The extent covered.
parameter space | The scope of all possible parameters within a model (such as a function). When the parameters are of a function, it's just called the domain (short for "domain of definition").
